# Simple SRS

Simple SRS is a lightweight Chrome extension that lets you create and review your own flashcards without relying on any external service.

- Right click selected text and choose **Add Flashcard** to quickly open the popup with the selection filled in as the question.
- Use the popup from the extension toolbar to add cards or review any that are due.
- Reviews follow a 1h → 6h → 24h → 72h schedule. Every 5 minutes the extension checks for due cards and, outside of your quiet hours, shows a notification when it is time to review.
- Quiet hours can be configured on the settings page accessed from the extension options.
